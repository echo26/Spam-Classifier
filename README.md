# Spam-Classifier

  
This project is aiming to make a data model that is for spam emails classifications. I used Python, nltk tokenizer, RegEx and Naive Bayes.

I got a data from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/llabhishekll/fraud-email-dataset.


I predicted each email using Naive Bayes. I removed word with number using RegEx.

I got 86% accuracy and I saved it into JSON to use this data for developing spam-classifying program in the future.
