# Spam-Classifier

  
This project is aiming to make a data model that is for spam emails classifications. I used Python, nltk tokenizer, RegEx and Naive Bayes.

I got a data from Kaggle.

I predicted each email using Naive Bayes. I removed word with number using RegEx.

I got 86% accuracy and I saved BOW into JSON to use this data for the future use.
